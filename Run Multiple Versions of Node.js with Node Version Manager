# Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you will need the following:
The latest version of Node installed on your machine.

Step 1 — Getting Started
To get started, you will need to install the Node Version Manager, or nvm, on your system using curl or wget.
    #curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
                                        or
    #wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
Step 2 -
   add this line on linux ~/.basrcsh
   add this line on mac  /etc/zshrc
   export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
Step 3 — Installing Multiple Node.js Versions
         Now that you have nvm installed, you can install a few different versions of Node.js:
          #nvm install 0.10
          
        You can also install Node version 8 and version 12:
        #nvm install 8
        #nvm install 12
Step 4 — Listing Installed Node.js Versions
         With a handful of different versions of Node.js installed, we can run nvm with the ls argument to list out everything we have installed:
         #nvm ls
Step 5 — Setting a Default Node.js Version
         #nvm alias default 10.15
Step 6 — Switching Node.js Versions
         #nvm use 0.10
step 7 -- delete nodejs version 
          nvm uninstall 0.10
