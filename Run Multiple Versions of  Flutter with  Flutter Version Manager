Need  fvm
     Flutter 1.2.0 has been released and I have updated it, but some libraries didn’t work with them. So I had to keep both version: Stable and 1.17.4.It takes time to do an upgrade and downgrade every time. Then, I found a “fvm” to solve this situation
FVM
   Flutter Version Management, A simple CLI to manage Flutter SDK versions per project.
Step 1: Install Dart
    
    Install Dart on macOs with the following Command
          #brew tap dart-lang/dart
          #brew install dart
          #brew install dart@2.12   (To switch between locally installed Dart releases, first install the version you want to switch to if you haven’t. For example, to install Dart 2.12:)
          # brew info dart   (To see which versions of Dart you’ve installed)
      Uninstall
          #brew uninstall fvm
          #brew untap leoafarias/fvm
      FVM to manage your global Flutter install we recommend installing as a standalone.
          #dart pub global activate fvm
     
     Install Dart on LINUX with the following Command
          Perform the following one-time setup:
          #sudo apt-get update
          #sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
          #wget -qO- https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/dart.gpg
          #echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/dart.gpg arch=amd64] https://storage.googleapis.com/download.dartlang.org/linux/debian stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dart_stable.list
       Then install the Dart SDK:
          #sudo apt-get update
          #sudo apt-get install dart
         After installing the SDK, add its bin directory to your PATH. For example, use the following command to change PATH in your active terminal session:
          #export PATH="$PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin"
         To change the PATH for future terminal sessions, use a command like this:
           #echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/usr/lib/dart/bin"' >> ~/.profile
        
      Install Dart on WINDOW with the following Command
          Press Windows+R to open the Run window.
          Type cmd into the box. 
          Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter.
          To install the Dart SDK:
            >choco install dart-sdk
            To upgrade the Dart SDK:
            >choco upgrade dart-sdk
          If you can’t use the Dart SDK executables, add the SDK location to your PATH:

      In the Windows search box, type env.
      Click Edit the system environment variables.
      Click Environment Variables….
      In the user variable section, select Path and click Edit…. 
     Click New, and enter the path to the dart-sdk directory.
      In each window that you just opened, click Apply or OK to dismiss it and apply the path change.
      
      #run the following command to install fvm
          dart pub global activate fvm
       #run the following command to uninstall fvm
           dart pub global deactivate fvm
       #Also delete the fvm cache directory if you want to remove all the cached files and folders. The cache directory could be known by using the command fvm list
      
      
 commands
  >fvm releases   : List the available flutter versions
  >fvm install 2.0.6  :install flutter version 2.0.6 
  >fvm remove <version> : to remove specified flutter version
  >fvm global <version> : to set the global flutter version
  >fvm global beta      :  change the current global version to beta from stable.
  >fvm global stable   : use the stable version that we've just installed globally inside all of your projects
  >fvm use <version>  : to set the flutter version ProjectWise
  >fvm doctor   : to display the current fvm version and its configuration
  >fvm use
   _  .fvm Folder
      SDK Folder: This is the actual library of flutter for this particular version
      fvm_config.json: The fvm_config file says what particular version of flutter we are using for this project
  >> fvm flutter : run flutter build
