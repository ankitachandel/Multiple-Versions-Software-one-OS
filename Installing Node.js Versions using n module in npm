n is supported on macOS, Linux, including with Windows Subsystem for Linux, and various other unix-like systems. It is written as a BASH script but does not require you to use BASH as your command shell.


Setp 1:  firsly install nodejs on operating system 
    Node.js installation worked, so we can now focus our attention on npm, which was included in the install:
     # which npm
       /usr/bin/npm
     # npm --version
         6.13.7
    Install npm Updates
       #npm install -g npm@latest
       
    If you already have Node.js installed, an easy way to install n is using npm:
         #npm install -g n
    
    If npm is not yet available, one way to bootstrap an install:
        curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tj/n/master/bin/n -o n bash n lts
      # Now node and npm are available
          npm install -g n
     Alternatively, you can clone this repo and
          make install
Third Party Installers
  On macOS with Homebrew you can install the n formula.
   #brew install n
  Or on macOS with MacPorts you can install the n port:
   #port install n
  On Linux and macOS, n-install allows installation directly from GitHub; for instance:
   #curl -L https://git.io/n-install | bash
   
Step 2 : 
     Installing Node.js Versions
     Simply execute n <version> to download and install a version of Node.js. If <version> has already been downloaded, n will install from its cache.
      #n 10.16.0
      #n lts
      
commands :

    Removing Versions
        Remove some cached versions:
        # n rm 0.9.4 v0.10.0
        
    Removing all cached versions except the installed version:
         #n prune
     show the path to the downloaded node version:
         # n which 6.14.3
